# STA141B Final project

In this final project, you are going to write a shiny application to demonstrate the techniques that you learn in this course. You will need to obtain some data from the web.

If you are doing web scrapping, stick with static web scrapping. Dynamic web scrapping is not suitable for Shiny application.

Here is a list of public APIs for your reference: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
You are not limited to the APIs listed there, however, you are advised to focus on APIs with no authentication or using API keys.

## Requirements

- the application should be deployed to shinyapps.io or google cloud run
- the source code should be uploaded to github and share to the public.

## Grading criterion

Your grade will be determined based on the following criterion.

- (30%) novelty and practicalness
    - Is it useful? It would be very boring if you built an application which counts the number of seconds since big bang.
    - Is it user friendly. Of course , our course is not about software design but you do want to make sure that your app is not too hard to navigate.
- (30%) Statistical correctness. 
    - Make sure that your app is statistically sensible (if it is relevant).
    You do not want to produce anything that are statistical wrong, for example, using a piechart to show a quantitative variable.
    - For the statistical analyses, make sure the analyses were correctly done.
- (40%) coding
    - Is it usable? Bugs?
    - Is the code efficient?
    - Coding style. You want your code to be clean and well documented. Just imagine another people will be taking charge of the maintenance of your app. (Hint: make use of `styler`)
